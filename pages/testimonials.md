> "Jacob Nathanson played cello at several wedding receptions that my wife and I attended in the greater Pittsburgh area. His performance was excellent and added  much to the festive atmosphere. I highly recommend that you consider adding a classical performance by Jacob to your next gathering!"

> "Jacob's sounds are quite luxurious. They are soft and precise and blend perfectly with his trio. The music floated through a small crowd. It didnâ€™t overtake conversations but was clearly heard. The pieces he choose for the occasion were spot on. A great pleasure to hear him."
