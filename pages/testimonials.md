> "Jacob Nathanson played cello at several wedding receptions that my wife and I attended in the greater Pittsburgh area. His performance was excellent and added much to the festive atmosphere. I highly recommend that you consider adding a classical performance by Jacob to your next gathering!"

> "Jacob's sounds are quite luxurious. They are soft and precise and blend perfectly with his trio. The music floated through a small crowd. It didnâ€™t overtake conversations but was clearly heard. The pieces he choose for the occasion were spot on. A great pleasure to hear him."

> "I recently had the great pleasure of hearing Jacob Nathanon play as part of a trio at a wedding I attended. He plays the cello like the highly accomplished and talented musician he is, and is the heart of the trio. He is also very professional, dependable and committed to excellence in his performances. Jacob and his trio of fine musicians play exquisitely, and they would take any event to the next level of elegance."
